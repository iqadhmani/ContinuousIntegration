# Why MIT Licence
 It is very short, very easy to understand, and allows anyone to do anything with the application so long as they keep a copy of the   license, including my copyright notice. Also, I will be able to release the project under a different license if I ever need to.

# Deployment Instructions
 The application is ASP.NET Core 3 based. No connection to a database made, so it can run without a database server. Please run the solution in visual studio for express run.
 
 In order to install the application in your web server, please go to the Publish menu in visual studio. Choose IIS option on the left. Then go through the settings that match your IIS server configuration.
